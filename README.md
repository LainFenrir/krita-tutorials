# krita-tutorials
Repository for krita tutorials I write. Think of this as a complement to [Krita Official documentation](https://docs.krita.org/en/index.html), and I encourage you read that as well.  

I created lists for easy acess you can see them here:  

1. [Tutorials](tutorials/tutorial_list.md)
2. [Faqs](faqs/faq_general.md)
