# krita-tutorials
Repository for krita tutorials I write. Think of this as a complement to [Krita Official documentation](https://docs.krita.org/en/index.html), and I encourage you read that as well.  
Disclaimer: I am in no way related to the krita dev team, I am just a user who tries to help out the community.  
Other places you can get help for krita are the [krita-artists forum](https://krita-artists.org/), and [reddit /r/krita](https://www.reddit.com/r/krita/). 

I created lists for easy acess you can see them here:  

1. [Tutorials](tutorials/tutorial_list.md)
2. [Faqs](faqs/faq_general.md)
